For the lancet: reviewers (not sure it is possible to suggest though):

- Hans-Cristian Thorsen-Meyer, (don't succeed in getting his mail). Main author of
[an hourly prediction model in the ICU, published in the
lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30018-2/fulltext#%20).
Might be interested by our guideline. Hans-Cristian THorsen-Meyer seems [ into
ML](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FL__x7EAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao). 

- His boss might also be a good target, but downside is that he should be very busy: [SÃ¸ren
Brunak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=eNqd5xEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate),

- [Paul WG
Elbers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=jPPoHuAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), p.elbers@amsterdamumc.nl
author of the [AmsterdamUMCdb](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8132908/), also close to Leo.

- [Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/tianxi-cai/), close to Isaac
Kohane but she seems nice and very into prognosis but not causal. We already cite her in the paper.
